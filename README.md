# ⚔️ 2D Multiplayer Fighting Game (HTML/Canvas/JS)

A browser-based, two-player fighting game built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5 Canvas**, and custom animation logic. This project simulates real-time combat mechanics such as jumping, running, attacking, and taking damage — all while handling sprite animations, game loops, and collision detection from scratch.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design and develop a responsive, animated, two-player 2D game that simulates fighting mechanics using **raw web technologies** — no frameworks or game engines. This demonstrates practical knowledge of animation, DOM control, and player input handling in a dynamic environment.

## 🎮 Key Features

- 👥 **Two-Player Gameplay**: Simultaneous input support for both fighters (WASD + arrow keys)
- 🕹️ **Fully Custom Sprite Animations**: Frame-by-frame transitions for idle, run, jump, fall, attack, take hit, and death
- 🧠 **Custom Game Logic**:
  - Health bar updates
  - Attack collisions
  - KO detection and winner declaration
  - Physics-based gravity and jumping
- 🕒 **Countdown Timer** and endgame conditions
- 🧱 **HTML5 Canvas Rendering** with manual drawing and context layering
